## üéØ Usage

1. **Open VS Code in WSL** - Make sure you're running VS Code in WSL mode
2. **Right-click any file or folder** in the VS Code explorer panel
3. **Select "Reveal in File Explorer"** from the context menu
4. **Windows File Explorer opens** showing the selected file/folder location

That's it! No configuration needed by default.

## üîß How It Works

The extension automatically:
- Detects your WSL distribution name (or uses your custom configuration)
- Converts Linux paths to Windows UNC format (`\\wsl$\Distribution\path`)
- Uses PowerShell to reliably open Windows File Explorer
- Handles path escaping and special characters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Custom WSL Distribution Name

If automatic detection fails or you have a custom WSL distribution name, you can override it:

1. **Via Settings UI**:
   - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "WSL Reveal Explorer"
   - Set "Default Distribution Name" to your distribution name

2. **Via settings.json**:

   ```json
   {
     "wsl-reveal-explorer.defaultDistributionName": "Ubuntu2"
   }
   ```

**Common examples**:

- `Ubuntu2` - for secondary Ubuntu installations
- `Ubuntu-22.04` - for version-specific Ubuntu distributions
- `Debian` - for Debian distributions
- `kali-linux` - for Kali Linux distributions

**Note**: Leave this setting empty (default) to use automatic detection.

### Custom Path Prefix for Remote SSH

For Remote SSH connections or custom network drives, you can configure a custom path prefix:

1. **Via Settings UI**:
   - Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`)
   - Search for "WSL Reveal Explorer"
   - Set "Path Prefix" to your network path

2. **Via settings.json**:

   ```json
   {
     "wsl-reveal-explorer.pathPrefix": "\\\\server\\share",
     "wsl-reveal-explorer.defaultDistributionName": ""
   }
   ```

**Examples**:

- **WSL (default)**: `"\\\\wsl$"` - Standard WSL access
- **Network Share**: `"\\\\server\\share"` - Direct network share access
- **Mapped Drive**: `"\\\\192.168.1.100\\projects"` - IP-based network path
- **SSHFS Mount**: `"\\\\sshfs\\hostname"` - SSHFS mounted drives

**Note**: When using custom path prefixes, the distribution name is optional and can be left empty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

To contribute or modify this extension:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd vscode-wsl-reveal-explorer

# Open in VS Code
code .

# Press F5 to run in Extension Development Host
# Test the functionality by right-clicking files in the explorer
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If the extension doesn't work:
1. **Ensure you're running VS Code in WSL mode or Remote SSH** (not Windows locally)
2. **Verify that PowerShell is available** on your Windows system
3. **Check that Windows File Explorer can access your configured paths manually**
   - For WSL: `\\wsl$\<distribution>`
   - For Remote SSH: Your custom network path

### Distribution Detection Issues

If the extension opens the wrong folder or fails to work:

1. **Check your actual WSL distribution name**:

   ```bash
   # In WSL terminal, run:
   wsl.exe -l -v
   ```

2. **Set the correct distribution name manually**:
   - Use the exact name from the command above
   - Go to VS Code Settings and search for "WSL Reveal Explorer"
   - Set "Default Distribution Name" to the correct name (e.g., `Ubuntu-22.04`, `Ubuntu2`)

3. **Common distribution name issues**:
   - Auto-detection might return `Ubuntu` but your distribution is `Ubuntu2`
   - Version-specific names like `Ubuntu-20.04` vs `Ubuntu-22.04`
   - Custom installation names

### Remote SSH Issues

For Remote SSH connections:

1. **Verify your network path configuration**:
   - Set the correct `pathPrefix` in settings
   - Test the path manually in Windows File Explorer

2. **Common Remote SSH scenarios**:
   - **SSHFS mounts**: Configure path like `\\\\sshfs\\hostname`
   - **Network shares**: Use `\\\\server\\share` format
   - **Direct IP access**: Use `\\\\192.168.1.100\\path` format

3. **Path mapping examples**:

   ```text
   Remote path: /home/user/project
   Windows path: \\server\share\home\user\project
   Configuration: "pathPrefix": "\\\\server\\share"
   ```
